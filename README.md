## Summary
The purpose of this homework assignment was to use make a game that involved clicking buttons to add to a total that might equal the winning number. This involved using jquery to change elements on the browser depending on the button pressed and the running total.

## Steps
1. Create the HTML file index.html, CSS files reset.css and style.css, and Javascript file game.js. Link CSS and Javascript files to HTML in the head.

2. In index.html, add elements for the page and assign them ids to call on for the JQuery. It is essential to add buttons to the page to allow user input.

3. In game.js, add variables for total, wins, and losses. Add JQuery to assign values to the HTML elements. The value of these HTML elements is going to be the result of a created function betweenNum() to generate a random number from 1-12 using Math.floor and Math.random. Assign the winning number variable a random number using betweenNum(). 

4. Next we add button functionality. Based on the button clicked on, we add to the total. If the total equals the winning number we meet the winnning condition and add 1 to the number of wins. If the total is greater than the winning number, we meet the losing condition and add 1 to the number of losses.

5. Paste the Meyer Web reset sheet in reset.css. Add any custom stylings to the style.css. I went to Google Fonts to find a specific font for the page.
